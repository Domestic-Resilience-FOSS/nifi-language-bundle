<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
	This processor uses the Apache-licensed <a href="https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua">Lingua</a> library to
	detect the language of a block of text extracted using RecordPath operations.
</p>
<h2>Configuration Properties:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Input RecordPath - The RecordPath operation that builds the block of text to use for analysis.</li>
	<li>Output RecordPath - The RecordPath operation that finds the field where the language code will be inserted.</li>
	<li>Unknown Language - Provide a default language code to use when the language cannot be determined.</li>
</ul>
